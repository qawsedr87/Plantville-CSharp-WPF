# Plantville Online

## Notes
1. If the server hasn't been hit in a while, it takes a while to wake up. So be patient on the first load, it may take 30 seconds or so.
2. Plantville Online builds on the last Plantville project. Once you turn in your Plantville project, you have the option of using your previous Plantvillle code or mine. Ask me if you want my code.
